This directory contains a subset RNA-seq data from Himes et al 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52778) that was downloaded and subsampled 
to be used as a lightweight test dataset to quickly run the pipeline after making changes i.e.:

```
seqtk sample -s100 SRR1039508_1.fastq 10000 | bgzip -c > N61311_untreated_1.fq.gz
```
